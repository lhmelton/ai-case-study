The Right People with the Right Product with Artificial Intelligence
Overview and Origin

HowNow is a United Kingdom based company specializing in replacing standard Learning Management Systems (LMS) traditionally used by business and organizations with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system which pairs employees with appropriate training materials (gethownow.com, 2023).  Traditionally, various companies roll out generic training materials to all employees regardless of their relevance to their individual purpose or mission.  Using AI, HowNow works with employees to determine their purpose and identifies proper training materials to specifically meet their needs (gethownow.com, 2023).  Machine Learning is utilized to push content to employees who need it (ai-startups.org, 2023).

HowNow was founded in 2015 by Nelson Sivalingam and Kuvera Sivalingam (Pitchbook.com, 2023).  Currently they have approximately sixty-nine employees and is considered a privately held company (Pitchbook.com, 2023).  Initially founded as Wonderush, HowNow was funded with approximately $291,000.  They have grown to almost $50 million (Pitchbook.com, 2023). 

#Business Activities
HowNow set out to change how various companies trained their employees.  They wanted to make learning meaningful (gethownow.com, 2023).  The company wants to solve the problem of useless training and eliminate the time and energy of employees training with no results and not applicability (gethownow.com, 2023).  By developing meaningful training, they could present that training to their intended customer – the everyday employee.  This has created a huge customer base because their training model can benefit most anyone.  Many people are regretfully leaving their present companies due to a lack of learning and growth (LinkedIn, 23).  With custom, targeted learning, HowNow can help these employees.

The solution HowNow offers that other companies lack is the use of AI to align people’s goals to the business priorities.  The companies AI solution will help identify specific individual priorities while matching that with the company’s goals and identify a specific learning curriculum to those employees (Stringer, 2023).  By doing this, employees can focus their training time on quality tasks that benefit both the company and them.  There is no more boilerplate training such as a one size fits all.  It is all custom training which aligns directly with the employees and company.

According to Bersin (2020) employees rarely slow down to learn at work which in fact this is where they should be learning to perform their job better and more efficiently.  HowNow specifically enables employees to learn at work with the workflow (gethownow.com, 2023).  Simply by slowing down with directed, prioritized training, employees can increase their learning and thus their productivity dramatically (Stringer, 2020).  This is accomplished with AI that specifically identifies matching priorities of the company and the employee while recommending training solutions to meet those priorities.

#Landscape
HowNow is a United Kingdom based company using AI to improve education.  It provides targeted training to employees who want to learn at work.  AI has been traditionally used in formal education through the process of test generation, student evaluation and assessment (St. George and Svrluga, 2023).  Both environments help students by automating education, but the HowNow approach is making education and learning more personal and not just automated.  In the past 5-10 years AI has played a part to primarily help the educator but now, it is geared to a custom learning curriculum for students (gethownow.com, 2023).  It now offers data analysis and feedback for individual students (Rajawat, 2023).  This offers a custom experience for each student vastly departing from the one size fits all of previous educational environments.  There are several companies directly involving AI in meeting the needs of students.  These companies include Century Tech, Memrise, Osmo and many others (ai-startups.com, 2023).

#Results
The result of this approach seems to be good.  HowNow has grown from $291k to almost $50 million since its inception (Pitchbook.com, 2023).  HowNow has also focused on Human Resources (HR).  Its goal is to align HR representatives with business objectives through learning thus increasing the overall productivity of individual companies which is seen as a primary driving factor in their current growth (gethownow.com, 2023).  There are no published performance metrics however HowNow has sustained continued growth year after year (gethownow.com, 2023).

#Recommendations
HowNow has experienced steady growth.  The company’s focus on bringing customized training to everyone seems to have driven this incline.  They pride themselves on providing the right content to each individual and company.  However, while championing the right content they also tout to having over 5k resources to choose from when it comes to training (gethownow.com, 2023).  They specifically state people don’t want a lot of content, just the right content.  They should concentrate on the benefits AI can bring to not only the custom learning environment but reduce overhead costs.  AI can replace traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) and its creation.  Speechify is a leader in this area by having AI directly deliver custom training to customers with any learning materials, not just what is in a predetermined repository (Speechify.com, 2023). Many students learn better by listening in place of reading and Speechify will accomplish this task (Speechify.com, 2023).  HowNow could expand their business by integrating AI that uses all learning materials already chosen by the end user.  This would benefit HowNow by enabling customers to not only buy the right training as HowNow provides but also gives them the ability to use AI for learning materials already purchased or freely available.  This is good not only for the customers but for the general revenue cycle of HowNow as it will expand their product base and lead to a potential sales increase.  

This change will utilize Text to Speech technology thus enabling learners who have trouble reading and lack reading comprehension skills to listen to realistic voices and review vast amounts of materials (Murf.ai, n.d.).  Text to Speech technology will also allow learners to review materials away from work in multitasking situations such as driving to the store or work.  The learner can also learn while doing minimalistic tasks such as cleaning their home or doing simple yard work.  It really opens the doors to learning during convenient and motivational times for the learner.  

These technologies are appropriate in many facets of learning.  They will enable learners to get smarter at work with a very direct work/learning flow along with opportunities to learn with the convenience of opportunity anytime of the day.  Artificial Intelligence is integrating into many aspects of the learner’s life and making it easier to ingest content that is efficient, pertinent and convenient.
